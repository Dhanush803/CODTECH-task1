## Overview of the project 

### Project : developing a program for simple caluculator 

### Objective 
The objective of this project is to develop a simple calculator application using Python. The calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The goal is to provide a straightforward tool for performing calculations and to demonstrate fundamental programming skills in Python.

### Key Activities 
- **Basic Programming Constructs:** Implementing the calculator reinforced understanding of fundamental Python constructs such as functions, conditionals, and loops.
- **Error Handling:** The project highlights the importance of input validation and error handling to manage unexpected user inputs and ensure the calculator operates smoothly.
- **User Interface (CLI):** The project demonstrates how to build a simple command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction, offering a basis for developing more complex interfaces in future projects.

### Technologies used
**Python:** The primary programming language used for implementing the calculatorâ€™s logic and functionality.
**IDLE/Any Python IDE:** Development environment used for writing and testing the code
